    "raw_output": "**Score:** 9/10\n\n**Justification:** The business idea of DataSpaceHub, a trusted mobility data exchange platform, demonstrates exceptional market potential. The European mobility data space is expected to unlock new opportunities for mobility services, with a potential market size of €270 billion by 2028, driven by increasing demand for data-driven services and evolving EU regulation. The target customer segment, including public and private sector organizations, is clearly defined, and the platform's focus on mobility data and use of blockchain technology provides a unique value proposition. Additionally, the growing adoption of digital technologies in the mobility sector and the lack of accessibility of quality mobility data, with less than 15% of respondents stating that acquiring the data they need is not difficult, highlight a significant need for DataSpaceHub's services. The only concern is the high complexity of the mobility sector and the need for regulatory compliance, which may pose challenges for the platform's growth and adoption. However, overall, the market potential for DataSpaceHub is substantial, with a large and growing total addressable market, a clear customer segment, and significant willingness to pay for innovative data-driven services."
