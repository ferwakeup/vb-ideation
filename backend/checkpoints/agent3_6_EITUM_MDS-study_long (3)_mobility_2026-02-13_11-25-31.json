    "raw_output": "**Score:** 7/10\n\n**Justification:**\nThe DataSpaceHub business idea demonstrates a strong potential for affordable and rapid implementation, with a clear focus on leveraging blockchain technology to ensure data sovereignty, security, and transparency. The use of existing blockchain platforms like Hyperledger Fabric can accelerate development, reducing the need for extensive in-house development and thereby lowering initial investment costs. Additionally, the subscription-based revenue model and tiered pricing strategy can help manage costs for customers, making the platform more accessible. However, the implementation path requires a development team with specialized expertise in blockchain, data analytics, and mobility sector knowledge, which may pose a challenge in terms of cost and time. Furthermore, addressing regulatory complexities and ensuring data quality and standardization may add to the complexity and cost of implementation, preventing a perfect score in this dimension. Overall, while there are some challenges to be addressed, the business idea presents a solid foundation for rapid and affordable implementation, warranting a score of 7 out of 10."
