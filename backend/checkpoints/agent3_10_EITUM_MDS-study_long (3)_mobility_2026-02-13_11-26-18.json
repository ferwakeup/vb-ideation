    "raw_output": "**Score:** 8/10\n\n**Justification:**\nThe DataSpaceHub business idea scores high on the Product-Focused Output dimension, as it delivers value through a software output, specifically a trusted mobility data exchange platform. The platform's core offering, which includes blockchain-based data storage, advanced data analytics, and AI-powered data matching, is a repeatable product that can be scaled to meet the needs of various stakeholders in the mobility sector. Additionally, the platform's design allows for minimal customization, as it provides a standardized and efficient data exchange process, which aligns with the key evaluation question of minimal customization. However, the score is not a perfect 10, as the platform's success still depends on the establishment of a strong network of data providers and consumers, which may require some degree of human interaction and support, thereby slightly increasing the dependency on people. Nevertheless, the platform's ability to enable self-service through its user-friendly interface and automated data matching capabilities addresses the key evaluation question of customer self-service, making it a strong contender in the Product-Focused Output dimension."
