    "raw_output": "**Score:** 8/10\n\n**Justification:** The AI-Powered Traffic Management Platform demonstrates strong technical feasibility, leveraging existing technologies such as machine learning algorithms, IoT sensors, and cloud computing to provide a comprehensive traffic management solution. The utilization of real-time data from various sources, including traffic cameras and social media, to provide predictive analytics and optimized traffic signal control is technically achievable with current technology. However, the platform's reliance on high-quality and diverse data sources, as well as its need to address cybersecurity concerns and ensure data privacy, presents manageable challenges. The development team's expertise in AI, traffic management, and cloud computing is crucial to overcoming these challenges, and the platform's ability to learn from data and adapt to changing traffic patterns is a significant technical strength. Nevertheless, the integration with existing traffic infrastructure and the mitigation of potential job displacement in traditional traffic management roles may require additional technical considerations, preventing a perfect score."
