    "raw_output": "**Score:** 8/10\n\n**Justification:** DataSpaceHub's use of blockchain technology, such as Hyperledger Fabric, to ensure data sovereignty and security is a significant strength in terms of scalable technology and operations. The platform's ability to handle a large volume of data and provide secure and standardized data exchange is well-suited to handle 10x or 100x users, addressing the first key evaluation question. Additionally, the platform's automated data matching and analytics capabilities reduce the need for human effort in onboarding, addressing the second key evaluation question. However, the marginal costs of maintaining and updating the blockchain technology may not be close to zero, which could impact the platform's scalability and profitability, addressing the third key evaluation question. Overall, DataSpaceHub's technology and operations are well-designed to support scalable growth, but may require ongoing investment to maintain and improve the platform's performance and efficiency."
