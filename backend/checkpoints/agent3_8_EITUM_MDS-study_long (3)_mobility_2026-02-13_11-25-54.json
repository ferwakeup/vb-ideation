    "score": 8.0,
    "raw_output": "**Score:** 8/10\n\n**Justification:**\nThe business idea of DataSpaceHub, a trusted mobility data exchange platform, has a strong barrier to entry due to several factors. Firstly, the high development costs and complexity of blockchain technology, which is utilized to ensure data sovereignty and security, create a significant hurdle for new entrants. Additionally, the need for established partnerships with mobility stakeholders, such as transportation authorities, logistics companies, and mobility service providers, requires significant investment in building relationships and trust. The platform's focus on mobility data and its use of blockchain technology also require specialized expertise, which can be difficult to acquire. However, the score is not a perfect 10 because the market is still nascent, and the regulatory framework is evolving, which could create opportunities for new entrants to adapt and innovate. Furthermore, the lack of standardization and interoperability of data models and systems in the industry could be addressed by new entrants, potentially disrupting the market. Overall, while DataSpaceHub has a strong barrier to entry, it is not insurmountable, and the company must continue to innovate and expand its services to maintain its competitive advantage."
