    "raw_output": "**Score:** 8/10\n\n**Justification:** DataSpaceHub's business idea demonstrates strong AI enablement for core value, as it leverages AI-powered data matching to facilitate secure and standardized data sharing between mobility stakeholders. The platform's use of advanced data analytics and AI-driven features improves outcomes by enabling the development of innovative data-driven services and cost savings. Additionally, the platform's performance is likely to improve with usage and data, as the AI-powered data matching feature can learn from patterns and trends in the data to provide more accurate and efficient matching. However, the idea could be further strengthened by providing more details on how AI is central to the platform's core value proposition, and how it will continue to evolve and improve over time. The current implementation plan and revenue model do not explicitly highlight the role of AI in driving revenue growth or improving the platform's scalability, which prevents the idea from receiving a perfect score. Nevertheless, the incorporation of AI-powered features and advanced data analytics demonstrates a solid foundation for AI enablement, earning a score of 8 out of 10."
