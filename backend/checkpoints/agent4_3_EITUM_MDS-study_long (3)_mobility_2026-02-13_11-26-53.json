    "concerns": [
      "**Affordable & Rapid Implementation (7.0/10):** This score indicates a concern because it suggests that while the business idea has a solid foundation for rapid and affordable implementation, there are challenges to be addressed, such as the need for specialized expertise in blockchain, data analytics, and mobility sector knowledge, which may pose a challenge in terms of cost and time. This presents risks related to delays in development, increased costs, and potential difficulties in attracting and retaining the necessary talent. As a result, the implementation path may be more complex and costly than anticipated, potentially impacting the platform's competitiveness and market entry timing.",
      "**Sustainable Competitive Advantage (8.0/10):** Although this dimension has a relatively high score, it still presents a concern because DataSpaceHub's reliance on continuous innovation and expansion of services to ensure long-term sustainability may pose a challenge. This requires ongoing investment and adaptation to evolving market conditions and regulatory requirements, which can be risky and resource-intensive. The company's competitive advantage, while strong, is not exceptional, and the potential risks associated with maintaining its position in a rapidly evolving market may impact its ability to sustain growth and profitability.",
      "**Technical Feasibility (8.0/10):** This score indicates a concern because while the business idea is technically feasible, the implementation of blockchain technology can be complex, and ensuring data quality, standardization, and interoperability may pose significant technical challenges. Furthermore, the integration of AI-powered data matching may require significant development and testing to ensure its accuracy and reliability, which can be time-consuming and costly. These technical complexities may present risks related to delays, cost overruns, and potential security vulnerabilities, which can impact the platform's overall performance and user adoption."
