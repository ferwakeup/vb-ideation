    "score": 9.0,
    "raw_output": "**Score:** 9/10\n\n**Justification:** The AI-Powered Traffic Management Platform demonstrates exceptional AI enablement for its core value, as it leverages machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve safety. The platform's ability to learn from data and adapt to changing traffic patterns, providing more accurate predictions and recommendations over time, addresses the key evaluation question of whether AI improves outcomes, scale, or cost structure. The use of real-time traffic monitoring, predictive modeling, and optimized traffic signal control showcases how AI is central to the platform's core offering, making it irreplaceable. Furthermore, the platform's performance is expected to improve with usage and data accumulation, as the machine learning algorithms refine their predictions and recommendations. The only concern that prevents a perfect score is the potential challenge of ensuring data quality and privacy, which could impact the effectiveness of the AI-powered platform. Overall, the platform's strategic use of AI to drive its core value proposition positions it as a leader in this dimension."
