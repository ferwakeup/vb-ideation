    "score": 8.0,
    "raw_output": "**Score:** 8/10\n\n**Justification:**\nThe AI-Powered Traffic Management Platform demonstrates a strong sustainable competitive advantage, primarily due to its unique position in leveraging AI for predictive traffic management, backed by the EU's AI Act. The high development costs for similar AI-powered platforms and the need for extensive data collection and integration capabilities serve as significant barriers to entry, protecting the platform's market position. Additionally, the platform's ability to learn from data and adapt to changing traffic patterns through machine learning algorithms ensures continuous improvement, making it more accurate and effective over time. However, the score is not a perfect 10 because while the platform has a strong foundation, it still faces challenges such as ensuring data quality and privacy, addressing cybersecurity concerns, and mitigating potential job displacement, which could impact its long-term sustainability and competitiveness if not adequately addressed. The platform's structural advantages, including its potential for network effects through expanded data sources and user base, further support its sustainable competitive advantage."
